This repo contains some examples of Design Patterns in Java; it was split off from my main 
https://github.com/IanDarwin/javasrc[javasrc repo] to keep the latter from becoming bottom-heavy.

== Readings

The original book that popularized Design Patterns - after they were in use for a decade in the CS community - is
Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Software,
by Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vlissides, known more concisely as the Gang of Four or even the GoF.

A less academic, more memorable read is Head-First Design Patterns by O'Reilly.

More: coming soon!
